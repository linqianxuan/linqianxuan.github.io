                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how technology reshapes the world. My journey in computer science began with a deep curiosity about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision—powerful tools that are already shaping industries and everyday life. Through my academic and industrial experiences, I’ve built a strong foundation in these areas, but more importantly, I’ve realized that technology isn’t just about following existing paths. It’s about creating something new—contributing to the next wave of global innovation rather than merely adopting what’s already been established.</p>
        
                    <p>In the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to bridge theory with real-world applications. My hands-on experience in industry led to the development of two national invention patents—an experience that taught me how applied computer science can transform industries. Yet, while this work was impactful, I knew it only scratched the surface. The most exciting innovations today, particularly in AI, aren’t just about application; they’re about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. That’s the space I want to be in. I want to create solutions that don’t just optimize existing systems but redefine them entirely.</p>
        
                    <p>Research and innovation are filled with uncertainty. Following existing methods is often simpler, safer, and more cost-effective, but I believe that if I have the ability to contribute to the forefront of technology, then I should. The future of AI, automation, and intelligent systems isn’t something I want to passively observe—I want to shape it. I see my role as a contributor in the global wave of technological transformation, someone willing to take on the risks of research and development to bring something valuable into the world.</p>

            <h3>Technological Impact</h3>
            <p>At Jackson's Winery (Fujian) Co., Ltd., a National High-tech Enterprise and Chinese Time-Honored Brand, I contributed to industrial digitalization by implementing a digitalized production system with temperature-controlled fermentation to enhance yield rates. Additionally, I developed an industrial-scale digital optimization system, improving efficiency and quality in a traditional manufacturing environment. I aspire to apply my knowledge to help more traditional manufacturing enterprises achieve digitalized production and industrial upgrades.</p>
