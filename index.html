                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how technology reshapes the world. My journey in computer science began with a deep curiosity about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision—powerful tools that are already shaping industries and everyday life. Through my academic and industrial experiences, I’ve built a strong foundation in these areas, but more importantly, I’ve realized that technology isn’t just about following existing paths. It’s about creating something new—contributing to the next wave of global innovation rather than merely adopting what’s already been established.</p>
        
                    <p>In the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to bridge theory with real-world applications. My hands-on experience in industry led to the development of two national invention patents—an experience that taught me how applied computer science can transform industries. Yet, while this work was impactful, I knew it only scratched the surface. The most exciting innovations today, particularly in AI, aren’t just about application; they’re about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. That’s the space I want to be in. I want to create solutions that don’t just optimize existing systems but redefine them entirely.</p>
        
                    <p>Research and innovation are filled with uncertainty. Following existing methods is often simpler, safer, and more cost-effective, but I believe that if I have the ability to contribute to the forefront of technology, then I should. The future of AI, automation, and intelligent systems isn’t something I want to passively observe—I want to shape it. I see my role as a contributor in the global wave of technological transformation, someone willing to take on the risks of research and development to bring something valuable into the world.</p>

                <p>My honors thesis marked a defining moment in my academic journey. Focused on <strong>human motion synthesis</strong>, I developed a <strong>transformer-based autoencoder</strong> to generate realistic 3D human motion. By leveraging <strong>self-attention mechanisms</strong> and the <strong>SMPL model</strong>, my research tackled the challenge of synthesizing smooth and responsive motions from intuitive inputs, such as joystick gestures. Validated using the <strong>AMASS dataset</strong>, this research demonstrated the potential of AI-driven motion synthesis to enhance interactive experiences in gaming and virtual reality.</p>

                <p>Through this experience, I learned the intricacies of deep learning architectures, dataset processing, and the rigorous cycle of research and validation. Beyond the technical aspects, it reinforced the importance of resilience—balancing experimentation, failure, and iteration to reach meaningful results.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am collaborating with a senior PhD student on a cutting-edge <strong>3D research project</strong>, aiming for submission to <strong>ICCV in March 2025</strong>. This project allows me to deepen my expertise in <strong>computer vision and 3D modeling</strong>, expanding my research scope beyond motion synthesis.</p>

        <h3>Industry Reflection</h3>
        <p>During my industry experience, I had the opportunity to contribute to <strong>industrial digitalization</strong> at Jackson's Winery (Fujian) Co., Ltd., a <strong>National High-tech Enterprise</strong> and <strong>Chinese Time-Honored Brand</strong>. My work centered on optimizing traditional manufacturing processes through advanced computing technologies.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Developed a <strong>digitalized production system</strong> integrating <strong>temperature-controlled fermentation</strong> to enhance yield rates.</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented an <strong>industrial-scale digital optimization system</strong>, improving efficiency and product quality in a manufacturing environment.</li>
            <li>Secured <strong>two national invention patents</strong> for novel applications of AI-driven optimization in production processes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This experience shaped my understanding of the real-world applications of AI in industry. I saw firsthand how **computational intelligence** can drive efficiency in traditional manufacturing, and I realized the importance of bridging **cutting-edge research with practical implementation**.</p>

        <p>Looking ahead, I aspire to leverage my dual expertise in research and industry to develop <strong>scalable AI-driven solutions</strong> that facilitate digital transformation across sectors. By combining my technical knowledge with practical experience, I aim to contribute to the future of the intelligent automation, robotics, and AI-driven optimization.</p>
