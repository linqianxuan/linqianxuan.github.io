                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how technology reshapes the world. My journey in computer science began with a deep curiosity about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision—powerful tools that are already shaping industries and everyday life. Through my academic and industrial experiences, I’ve built a strong foundation in these areas, but more importantly, I’ve realized that technology isn’t just about following existing paths. It’s about creating something new—contributing to the next wave of global innovation rather than merely adopting what’s already been established.</p>
        
                    <p>In the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to bridge theory with real-world applications. My hands-on experience in industry led to the development of two national invention patents—an experience that taught me how applied computer science can transform industries. Yet, while this work was impactful, I knew it only scratched the surface. The most exciting innovations today, particularly in AI, aren’t just about application; they’re about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. That’s the space I want to be in. I want to create solutions that don’t just optimize existing systems but redefine them entirely.</p>
        
                    <p>Research and innovation are filled with uncertainty. Following existing methods is often simpler, safer, and more cost-effective, but I believe that if I have the ability to contribute to the forefront of technology, then I should. The future of AI, automation, and intelligent systems isn’t something I want to passively observe—I want to shape it. I see my role as a contributor in the global wave of technological transformation, someone willing to take on the risks of research and development to bring something valuable into the world.</p>

                    <p>When I first started my research, I thought I had to read one paper per day, absorb as much information as possible, and that eventually, ideas would naturally emerge. But I quickly realized that research isn’t about efficiency in the way coursework is. It isn’t about checking off papers or completing assignments—it’s about allowing <strong>time and space for ideas to emerge</strong>. Some of my best insights didn’t come from reading faster, but from <strong>wandering while reading</strong>, letting my thoughts expand in unexpected directions. <strong>Research, at its core, is about curiosity and openness, not rigid goals.</strong></p>
                
                    <h4>Uncertainty</h4>
                    <p>If the answer were already known, there wouldn’t be research in the first place. At first, I struggled with this—weeks without visible progress felt frustrating. But over time, I realized that progress in research isn’t linear; it’s recursive. You get stuck, you find a way forward, you get stuck again, and you keep going. I now treat this process as something natural—<strong>like breathing</strong>. The hard part isn’t solving a specific technical problem; it’s <strong>acknowledging how much I don’t know while still having faith in my ability to figure things out</strong>. If I’m stuck for more than three days, I seek help. <strong>No ego, just learning.</strong></p>
                
                    <h4>Failure</h4>
                    <p>I see failure not as a setback but as a <strong>Bayesian update</strong>. Each failed idea doesn’t just tell me what doesn’t work—it refines my sense of what might. That’s also why I love reading about history, business, economics, and different people’s lives—to train my intuition. I believe that <strong>well-developed intuition leads to better decisions in life</strong>.</p>
                
                    <blockquote>“Some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all.”<br>— J.K. Rowling</blockquote>
                
                    <p>To me, <strong>failure is as normal as breathing</strong>. And it isn’t pathetic to think this way, because as long as I keep going, <strong>success will become just as normal</strong>.</p>
                
                    <h4>Motivation</h4>
                    <p>I love uncertainty. I hate feeling stagnant. If everything were predictable, I would get bored. Research, for me, isn’t just about academia—it’s a <strong>mindset</strong>, a way of constantly asking questions about everything in life: <em>What is this? Why is that?</em> I don’t just want to <strong>consume knowledge; I want to create and contribute</strong>.</p>
                
                    <p>I also feel a deep sense of <strong>gratitude and responsibility</strong>. My supervisor, one of the top professors in our department, chose to take me as his <strong>only undergraduate honours student this year</strong>. He has been <strong>supportive without being pushy</strong>, and I feel privileged to have had this opportunity. And I believe that <strong>privilege comes with responsibility</strong>.</p>
                
                    <blockquote>“To whom much is given, much is expected.”</blockquote>
                
                    <p>This isn’t a burden—it’s <strong>a source of power</strong>. I feel fortunate to be in a position where I can contribute something meaningful.</p>
                
                    <h4>A Year of Commitment, Growth, and Gratitude</h4>
                    <p>This year, I worked harder than ever—not because I believe in <em>no pain, no gain</em>, but because <strong>my love for what I do outweighs the pain</strong>. Normally, I’m someone who is picky about food and values good sleep, but this year, I sometimes found myself eating oatmeal with water for lunch just to save time for the work I wanted to do, or waking up in the middle of the night to write down an idea before it disappeared. Not because I had to, but because I wanted to. Because <strong>this journey is mine, by choice</strong>.</p>

                    <h4>Continuing the Journey</h4>
                    <p>I am currently collaborating with a senior PhD student on a research project in <strong>3D synthesis and reconstruction</strong>, aiming for submission to <strong>ICCV in March 2025</strong>. This project expands my expertise beyond human motion synthesis, focusing on advanced techniques for reconstructing and generating complex 3D structures with greater accuracy and realism. </p>

                    <h3>Bridging Innovation with Real-World Impact</h3>
                    <p>Unlike the conventional approach of completing multiple internships, I dedicated my industrial experience to <strong>a single, deeply immersive collaboration</strong>—one that led to a <strong>National Invention Patent</strong>. My work at Jackson’s Winery (Fujian) Co., Ltd., a <strong>National High-tech Enterprise</strong> and <strong>Chinese Time-Honored Brand</strong>, focused on <strong>digital transformation in traditional manufacturing</strong>, applying computational intelligence to optimize industrial processes.</p>
    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed a digitalized production system, integrating temperature-controlled fermentation to enhance yield rates.</li>
                        <li>Designed an industrial-scale digital optimization system, improving efficiency and product quality in a traditional manufacturing environment.</li>
                        <li>Collaborated on a project that resulted in a <strong>National Invention Patent</strong>, introducing an AI-driven approach to water recycling and process automation.</li>
                    </ul>
    
                    <h3>My Reflections</h3>
                    <p><strong>Real innovation isn’t about isolated research — it’s about creating systems that solve real-world problems.</strong> Seeing a national invention patent materialize from my contributions reinforced this belief.</p>

    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    
    <p>I cherish moments of adventure and the thrill of exploring nature. I enjoy kayaking, surfing, and scuba diving, and I know that one day I will learn free diving—especially in <strong>Tonga, to see sleeping sperm whales</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Interestingly, I have very few photos from these activities because I prefer to be fully immersed in the experience. My favorite coral species is the <strong>Spirobranchus giganteus</strong>, commonly known as the **Christmas tree worm** 🎄—a little gift of the ocean.</p>
    
    <p>Here are glimpses of my life:</p>
